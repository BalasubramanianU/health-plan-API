# Scalable Health Plan API Platform

A secure, distributed, and search-enabled RESTful API for managing structured health insurance plans. This project is built using Node.js and follows modern microservice architecture principles, including schema validation, asynchronous indexing, and robust search capabilities.

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- CRUD operations on health plans with PATCH/merge support
- JSON Schema validation using AJV for strongly typed payloads
- ETag-based conditional GET and PATCH support
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT validation (Google Sign-In)
- Asynchronous message processing via RabbitMQ
- Parent-child indexing using Elasticsearch for advanced search
- Modular architecture with full containerization using Docker

---

**Tech Stack**

- **Backend** - Node.js, Express.js
- **Security & Authentication** - Google OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), JWK-to-PEM for signature validation
- **Storage & Caching** - Redis (key-value store)
- **Message Queue** - RabbitMQ
- **Search & Indexing** - Elasticsearch (with parent-child joins), Kibana (for search UI)
- **DevOps** - Docker, Docker Compose

---

**Setup local environment:**

Pre-requisites:

1. Have Docker runtime or Docker desktop
2. Have Postman to check endpoints
3. Execute all commands from project root

To Run the project:

1. `docker compose up` to start the containers
2. `npm run start` to the Node server and connect to the services
3. In Postman, setup up your OAuth 2.0 tokens by referring the steps below
4. Check different endpoints with appropriate headers
5. `docker compose down` to stop the containers

**OAuth 2.0 setup - Google Auth with Postman:**

Setup Reference: https://blog.postman.com/how-to-access-google-apis-using-oauth-in-postman/

1. Setup an OAuth 2.0 client in your google cloud project
2. Redirect URI: https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback
3. After creation, you can see your client ID and secret, you have to later provide it in the Postman
4. In your Postman, for the Authorization setup, choose OAuth 2.0 and setup,

   1. Callback URL - https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback
   2. Auth URL - https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth (since its google auth)
   3. Access token URL - https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
   4. Client Id and secret, you can get from your google auth client, which you had setup
   5. Scope - openid email profile
   6. Initially, you would need to sign in, after it, you will receive the auth code, click `Get New Access Token`. Choose `Use Token` and change the token type to `ID Token` in the Postman Authorization settings page.
   7. Repeat step 7, whenever you need a new token or if your token expires

## Accessing services in docker containers

- Kibana - [localhost:](http://localhost:5601/app/dev_tools#/console)
- RabbitMQ - http://localhost:15672/#/
- ElasticSearch - http://localhost:9200
- In terminal, `redis-cli` to access redis db. Once accessed,
  - `keys *` to view all the keys
  - `get <key>` to see their values

## Endpoints Demo:

- In Postman, for each endpoint request have the authorization header as `Oauth 2.0` with Token type as `ID token`. You can either choose Inherit auth from parent and configure OAuth 2.0 header for a group or you can choose OAuth 2.0 individually for each endpoint and set it up.

**Positive Scenarios**

- `POST` request with localhost:3000/v1/plan/ with the JSON payload. Returns `201` with the `ETag` in the header in the response

```json

        "copay": 175,
        "deductible": 10,
        "objectId": "1234512xvc1314sdfsd-506",
        "objectType": "membercostshare"
      }
    }
  ],
  "objectId": "12xvxc345ssdsds-508",
  "objectType": "plan",
  "planCostShares": {
    "_org": "example.com",
    "copay": 23,

    "objectId": "1234vxc2324sdf-501",
    "objectType": "membercostshare"
  },
  "planType": "inNetwork"
}
```

- `GET` request with localhost:3000/v1/plan/1234vxc2324sdf-501 with the header `If-None-Match: ce0482a9a2aab5133a68d4f26ca2d042`. The header value is the ETag value taken from POST response. Returns `304`
- Same `GET` request again without `If-None-Match` header or with incorrect value in it. Returns `200` with the appropriate value of the objectId in the URL
- Similarly, for `GET`, with no plan id to fetch all the plans
- `DELETE` request with localhost:3000/v1/plan/1234vxc2324sdf-501. Returns `204` for success
- `PATCH` request with localhost:3000/v1/plan/1234vxc2324sdf-501. Returns `200` with the updated `ETag` for success. The payload for it would be

```json
{
  "linkedPlanServices": [
    {
      "linkedService": {
        "_org": "example.com",
        "objectId": "1234520xvc30sfs-505",
        "objectType": "service",
        "name": "well baby"
      },
      "planserviceCostShares": {
        "deductible": 10,
        "_org": "example.com",
        "copay": 175,
        "objectId": "1234512xvc1314sdfsd-506",
        "objectType": "membercostshare"
      },
      "_org": "example.com",
      "objectId": "27283xvx9sdf-507aaaa",
      "objectType": "planservice"
    }
  ],
  "objectId": "12xvxc345ssdsds-508"
}
```

**Negative Scenarios**

- POST -> `400` for non-json type payload or invalid json, `415` for wrong payload type
- GET -> `400` if the request has any payloads, `404` for object not present in database
- DELETE -> `404` for object not present in the database to delete
- PATCH -> `400` for non-json type payload or invalid json, `404` for object not present, `412` for not trying to update the latest resource, `415` for wrong payload type
